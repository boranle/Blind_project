Attempting to automate broken blinds

Servo motor out of the box (MG996R) only working with 180 degrees of motion but no stops on gears therefore allowing the possibility of continuous rotation. After dismantling servo and adjusting the potentiometer servo capable of continuous rotation. Fine tuning for resistance values required.
